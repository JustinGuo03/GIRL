            <h3>The Beginnings</h3>
            <p>
                As a program, Gaming IRL is designed to help students learn the fundamental soft skills needed to traverse the workplace with ease through 
                popular team-based video games such as League of Legends and Rocket League. Students get the opportunity to be coached not just in gameplay 
                but also in skills like communication, teamwork, and leadership. 
                Originally a brain child of our founder, Alisha Fariz, the program took off as it caught the attention of the local university (UNCW) and
                ran its first pilot during the summer of 2021.

            <h3>Video Games to Soft Skills</h3>
            <p>
                Video games, like Rocket League and League of Legends, provide a perfect field for students to consistently
                practice skills like teamwork and communication whiel having a fun time doing it. With guidance from professionals,
                students can improve the skills that are necessary in college and beyond. Each day in our program will start out with an introduction to
                the day's topic, such as a soft skill. They will learn about the skill and how to use it efficiently before transitioning to gaming, where
                students will put what they just learned to practical use.
